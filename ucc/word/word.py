# word.py

r'''The generic `word` class, along with xml read/write routines for it.

This is one of several representations for a word.  This `word` object is
created by the IDE when a `package` is opened and lives for as long as the
package stays open.  This may encompass several `ucc.compiler.compile` and
`ucc.codegen.load` steps.

This `word` object knows the name (internal name), label (user name), kind
(name of the word that this is a kind of), defining (bool, True if subclass of
declaration, False if instance), `questions` and `answers`, and the location of
the permanent .xml and source files for this word.  The `top_package` object
loads all of the words needed for a package and adds some other attributes to
each word:

    top
      A boolean indicating whether this word is directly in the top-level
      package (the one opened in the IDE) or not.

    kind_obj
      The kind `word` object (whereas 'kind' is just that object's name).
    
    subclasses
      A list of `word` objects that are direct subclasses of this word (only
      defining words have anything here).
      
      This list is sorted by label.lower().
    
    instances
      A list of `word` objects that are direct instances of this word (only
      defining words have anything here).
      
      This list is sorted by label.lower().
    
    filename_suffix
      None or string starting with '.'.  Only set on defining words.

These `word` objects are used by the compiler, along with the subclasses and
instances of the `ucclib.built_in.declaration` class.  The IDE doesn't use the
declaration classes and instances.
