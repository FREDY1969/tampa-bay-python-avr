Here is how register allocation works.

Register Classes and Vertexes:

There are several register classes, rc, (depending on the machine architecture).
It is assumed that for any two rc's, either one is a subset of the other, or
they are completely disjoint.  So each rc has a set of subset rcs (which
generally includes itself).

Also, there may be more than one register class that map the same set of
registers.  In the AVR architecture, for example, "single" includes all
(single) registers, and "pair" includes all consecutive even and odd numbered
pairs of registers.  So every register belongs to both register classes.

To deal with this, a "vertex" is used to represent register classes.  All
register classes mapping to the same set of registers are assigned to the same
vertex, and the subclass/superclass arrangements are between vertexes.

Much of the allocation works with all subsets of an vertex (including the
vertex itself).  A "top down" order means going from superset to subset.
A "bottom up" order means going from subset to superset.

Register Uses:

There are two kinds of register uses which compete for the same limited set of
registers:

    A.  Local variables (including parameters)
    B.  Temporary uses

Either of these may be "spilled" to memory if there are not enough registers
to go around.

Local Variable Register Use:

Local variables may be set and referenced any number of times.

Because we're not doing optimization, specifically live variable analysis, we
assume that all local variables require the register for the lifetime of the
function unless they are spilled to memory.

The compiler examines all uses of each local variable to see if there is a
register class that is a common subset of the register class required for
each use.  If so, the compiler assigns the local variable to that register
class.  If not, the compiler assigns the local variable to the register class
that works for the most uses (sets and references).

Note that for each block, a local variable can have at most one "local" triple
and at most one "set" label on a triple (the last one in the block to assign to
that local variable).  The "local" and "set" are already treated as temporary
register uses by the compiler.  We can pretty much treat local variables the
same way we treat temporary register uses if:

    1.  for every "local" triple, a pseudo register use is added from the
        beginning of the block containing the "local" and ending at the
        "local".
    2.  for every "set", the register use starting at that "set" is extended
        to the end of the block containing the "set".
    3.  for every block not containing either a "local" or "set" for a local
        variable, a pseudo register use is added for that local variable
        extending from the beginning to the end of that block.

These pseudo register uses will be modified later when live variable analysis
is available.

Temporary Register Use:

Temporary register uses start with the output of a single triple.  This always
represents the sole definition in that register's use, and is always the first
use, or "head" of the register usage chain.

After that, there may be any number of references to the register spread across
time (these are currently limited to the same block, but that will change when
the optimizer is implemented).  These references are simply all of the
triple_parameters that link to this head triple as their parameter_id.

In addition, there may be points in the reference list where the rc changes --
these are indicated by the move_prior_to_needed or move_needed_to_next flags
in the triple_parameter.  The move_needed_to_parent flag indicates a brief need
to use some other rc.

If the register use is spilled, the copy to memory is always done at the
initial definition (the head).  This copy in memory may then be used at any
reference point, regardless of its rc.  But the data may remain valid for some
time in the register, so that copying the data from memory back to the register
each time it is referenced may not be needed (if a spill was not required
during that stretch of time).  Therefore, spilling a _reference_ in the
register usage always also spills the _head_; but not vice versa.

Algorithm:

1.  Assign temps and locals to the vertex they need.  (No moving to subclasses
    yet).

2.  Loop bottom up, considering all sibling vertexes together:

    A.  For each sibling vertex, V, spill what won't fit:

        a.  Create chains of ru's, TC's, that can all occupy the same register.
        b.  Loop until no more to spills needed or no more free space in child
            reg classes:
            - Reassign the most expensive TC/local to the child vertex that
              has the most available registers.
        c.  Loop until no more spills needed:
            1. For each TC that won't fit (bottom up, starting at overflow
               point):
               - For each block, B, in TC:
                 A. Figure out the best solution for this block.  This may be a
                    set of temps to spill, or a local to save/restore (+ temps).
                    Remember that you can spill temps from child vertexes
                    (recursively) too!
                    - For each ru in TC in B:
                      - Pick the segment, S, in V or subset of V, not in TC,
                        containing ru that contains the most remaining ru's in
                        TC.  Break ties by selecting the S that already has
                        it's head spilled.
                        - Penalty for either endpoint in any ru still in TC.
                          These could just be subtracted from the contained ru
                          count.
                        - Seems like locals can be treated the same, except that
                          if there is a "local", it would be treated as a
                          segment from the start of the block, ending at the
                          "local".  And if the block has a "set", there would
                          be a final segment added to the "set"s register
                          usage extending to the end of the block.  And if
                          there was neither a "local" or "set" in a block it
                          would be treated as a single segment spanning the
                          whole block.  (Need to combine "local" and "set" into
                          one ru to use same register too).
                      - Delete all contained ru's, in the selected S, from TC
                 B. Store this as Chosen(TC, B)
                 C. Figure out what the cost (0-2) would be if each local was
                    spilled.  Make a list of all locals that have a lower cost,
                    if spilled, than Chosen(TC, B).  Store these as
                    Spilled_local(TC, B, local).  For all locals that are more
                    expensive spilled than Chosen(TC, B), set Spilled_local(TC,
                    B, local) to Chosen(TC, B).
                    - when a local is spilled:
                      - there would be no dummy segments before "local", after
                        "set", or spanning blocks that don't use that local
                        variable.
                      - different ru's could use different register assignments
                        and/or different register classes.
              2. Try all combinations mapping locals to TC's and pick the
                 combination, C, with the greatest total savings.
                 - The savings of L and TC is:
                     sum(Chosen(TC, all B)) -
                       (Spill_cost(L) + sum(Spilled_local(TC, all B, L)))
              3. If a combination is found:
                 - For each L, TC where L is spilled:
                   - Mark L as spilled
                   - For all B: set Chosen(TC, B) = Spilled_local(TC, B, L)
              4. For each TC, B:
                 - record the Chosen(TC, B) as the answer for B

    B.  Reassign entire temp register usages from super to fill holes in
        chains in the siblings (but not increase the number of registers
        needed in each sibling).

        a.  Let OC(ru, V) be the max overlap count of register usage, ru, and
            all other ru's in vertex, V, including ru itself.
        b.  Let RC(V) be the number of registers (register count) in vertex
            (excluding subclasses).
        c.  Let RN(V) be the number of registers needed for vertex (excluding
            subclasses).  This will always be <= RC(V).
        d.  Loop until no more ru's can be reassigned:
            1.  Calc OC(ru, super), for each register usage, ru, in super.
                Select ru's with OC(ru, super) > RC(super).
            2.  Calc, left overs:
                  LO(ru, sibling) = RN(sibling) - OC(ru, sibling)
                for each selected ru and each sibling.  Select ru's that have
                at least one LO(ru, sibling) >= 0 and remember the greatest
                LO(ru, sibling).
            3.  Reassign the ru (if any) with the greatest (OC(ru, super),
                LO(ru, sibling)) to the sibling.

To handle function calls:

1.  For each function, F, do the routine above.  For each function, S, called
    by F, for each V, set SV(F, S, V) to the max number of registers that F
    needs to save across all calls to function, S, for V.

2.  For each function, S, and vertex V, take the second highest count of all
    callers, F, of SV(F, S, V) as the number of registers to save/restore on
    entry/exit to S.  Store these as FS(S, V).

3.  For each function, S, and vertex, V:
    - find the function, F, with highest SV(F, S, V).  Do:
        SV(F, S, V) -= FS(S, V)
    - for all other functions, F2, not equal to F:
        SV(F2, S, V) = 0
